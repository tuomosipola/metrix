Summary:                     Typeset metric marks for Latin text

Description:
The metrix package can be used to print the prosodics/metrics of (latin) verses. It provides macros to typeset the symbols stand alone and in combination with syllables (including automatic alignment). Furthermore it defines a new brevis and a longa accent as well as a bow to contract syllables.
